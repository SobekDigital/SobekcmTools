SobekCM Management and Reporting Tool

-----------------------------------------

ABOUT

This tool is used to query a SobekCM library locally, bulk import records, 
pull metadata or files from a local instance, and perform tracking functions 
during digitization/loading of resources. Features which are supported by 
the web application are seamlessly integrated with this tool. This tool 
currently must be used with network access to the SobekCM database.
