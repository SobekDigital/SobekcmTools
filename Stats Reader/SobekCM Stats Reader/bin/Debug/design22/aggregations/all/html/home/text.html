<p>The University of Florida Digital Collections (UFDC) is a library of locally digitized and born digital resources. Excluding <a href="http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/find.html" target="_blank">commercial library resources</a> available elsewhere, the UFDC holds archival, library and museum materials and other data. The Collections are group topically and refined into narrower collections and subcollections for targetted research. Collection strengths are in Florida and the greater Caribbean basin area, environmental and agricultural sciences, and children's literature. Books, journals, and maps are found among their holdings. Audio and video files, as well as, numeric data may also be found among the Collections. </p>
<p>Collections originate from a variety of sources. The majority originate within the Libraries' <a href="http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/default.htm" target="_blank">Special and Area Studies Collections</a> and from  collections in the <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Florida Museum of Natural Sciences</a> and the <a href="http://www.harn.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art</a>.  Univerity of Florida colleges and departments, including their faculty and students also contribute to these Collections.
